FACTORS FOR SEO

1. Keyword in Subdomain
2. Private WhoIs information may be a sign of “something to hide”
3.  Having a Country Code Top Level Domain (.cn, .pt, .ca) can sometimes help the site rank for that particular country… but it can limit the site’s ability to rank globally.
4. Keyword in Title Tag
5. Title Tag Starts with Keyword
6. Keyword in Description Tag
7. Keyword Appears in H1 Tag
8. How often does a certain word appear in a document?”. The more often that word appears on a page, the more likely it is that the page is about that word.
9. Content with more words can cover a wider breadth and are likely preferable in the algorithm compared to shorter, superficial articles
10.  Using a linked table of contents can help Google better understand your page’s content
11. Latent Semantic Indexing Keywords in Content (LSI)
12. LSI Keywords in Title and Description Tags
13. pages that cover every angle likely have an edge vs. pages that only cover a topic partially.
14. Page Loading Speed via HTML
15. Use of AMP
16. Entity Match
17. Google Hummingbird
18. Identical content on the same site (even slightly modified) can negatively influence a site’s search engine visibility
19. Rel=Canonical: When used properly, use of this tag may prevent Google from penalizing your site for duplicate content.
20. Image Optimization: Images send search engines important relevancy signals through their file name, alt text, title, description and caption.
21. Content Recency
22. The significance of edits and changes also serves as a freshness factor. Adding or removing entire sections is more significant than switching around the order of a few words or fixing a typo.
23. Historical Page Updates
